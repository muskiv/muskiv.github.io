        <p class="becoming">In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison
            Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the
            convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings.
            Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards
            from reaching his heart and killing him.</p>
        <p class="becoming">Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor
            to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen
            sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the
            cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the
            desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture
            weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as
            well as a more powerful arc reactor.</p>
        <p class="becoming">Stark learns that Obadiah Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is
            staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and
            saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing
            that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it
            and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being <p class="i">"Iron
                Man."</p>
